# APK Extractor

Forked source code of axxapy project (https://github.com/axxapy/apkExtractor) : this project is an open source way to create apk packages from installed softwares on our Android phone only.

You don't need to have an Internet connection on the phone / tablet : .APK file of the selected application is created from the datas on the phone / tablet.
